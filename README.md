# platformer
A fun iOS platformer game

Update:
I took a hiatus on development of this project, as I was looking for music to fit the game. Nothing online suited the project. So I ended up developing an interest in music production. Years later, I have produced a song that has finally approached what I was looking for: The Edge (available in this repo)

Here are some images of the game in action
